# Notes
	If youâ€™re using JWT, make sure only userId is stored â€” and always fetch user + role from DB to get the latest permissions.
    Permissions are dynamic â€” so changes to the roleâ€™s permissions reflect immediately.

# Logger Further Enhancements
	â€¢	Add correlation ID support.
	â€¢	Push logs to an external service (Elastic, Datadog, Loki).
	â€¢	Customize log format (e.g., JSON for prod).
    ðŸ§  Future Ideas
	â€¢	Add correlation ID per request (with UUID).
	â€¢	Add log level config from .env.
	â€¢	Export logs to ELK, Datadog, or Sentry.

Would you like me to:
	â€¢	Automatically log all uncaught errors or promise rejections?
	â€¢	Add tests for the logger?
	â€¢	Add correlation ID middleware?
